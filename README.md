# Lawn-Mower
- team project

- This prototype of a lawn mower is actuated by 2 motors.
- It is controlled by a mobile application from which you can control the movement direction (forward, right, left, back) and the height at which you want the grass to be cut (rack and pinion mechanism - 5 levels of height).
- The lawn mower will go forward until it reaches an obstacle.

- I did the back-end part and I connected the components to be ready to put on the wooden prototype.
